			<h2 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">XI</h2>
			<p>When Tristrem reached Narragansett he had himself driven to an hotel, where he removed the incidental traces of travel before venturing to present himself at the villa. It was a glorious forenoon, and as he dressed, the tonic that was blown to him through the open window affected his spirits like wine. The breeze promised victory. He had been idle and dilatory, he told himself; but he was older, the present was his, and he felt the strength to make it wholly to his use. The past would be forgotten and put aside; no, but utterly, as Nature forgets⁠—and in the future, what things might be!</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song" xml:lang="fr">
				<p>
					<span>“O Magali, ma bien aimée,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fuyons tous deux, tous de⁠—ux⁠—”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>The old song came back to him, and as he set out for the villa he hummed it gayly to himself. The villa was but the throw of a stone from the hotel, and in a moment he would be there. He was just a little bit nervous, and he walked rapidly. As he reached the gate his excitement increased. In his breast was a tightening sensation. And then at once he stopped short. On the door of the cottage hung a sign, bearing for legend, “To Let⁠—Furnished.”</p>
			<p>“But it is impossible,” he exclaimed, “they were to be here till October.”</p>
			<p>He went up and rang the bell. The front windows were closed and barred. The porch on which he stood was chairless. He listened, and heard no sound. He tried the door⁠—it was locked.</p>
			<p>“But it is impossible,” he kept repeating. “H’m! ‘To let⁠—furnished; for particulars apply to <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J. F.</abbr> Brown, at the Casino.’ Most certainly, I will⁠—most certainly,” and monologuing in the fashion that was peculiar to him, he went down the road again, mindful only of his own perplexity.</p>
			<p>On reaching the Casino he found that he would have no difficulty in seeing the agent. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Brown, the doorkeeper told him, was “right in there,” and as he gave this information he pointed to a cramped little office which stood to the left of the entrance.</p>
			<p>“Is this <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Brown?” Tristrem began. “<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Brown, I am sorry to trouble you. Would you be good enough to tell me about <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Raritan’s cottage. I⁠—”</p>
			<p>“For next summer? Nine hundred, payable in advance.”</p>
			<p>“I didn’t mean about the price. I meant⁠—I was told that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Raritan had taken it until October⁠—”</p>
			<p>“So she did. You can sublet for the balance of the season.”</p>
			<p>“Thank you⁠—yes⁠—but <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Raritan hasn’t gone away, has she?”</p>
			<p>“She went weeks ago. There’s nothing the matter with the cottage, however. Drainage excellent.”</p>
			<p>“I have no doubt. But can you tell me where <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Raritan went to?”</p>
			<p>“I haven’t the remotest idea. Lenox, perhaps. If you want to look at the cottage I’ll give you the key.”</p>
			<p>“I should think⁠—Really, I must apologize for troubling you. Didn’t <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Raritan leave her address?”</p>
			<p>“If she did, it wasn’t with me. When do you want the cottage for?”</p>
			<p>Tristrem had not the courage to question more. He turned despondently from <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Brown, and passing on through the vestibule, reached the veranda that fronts the sea. In an angle a group of violinists were strumming an inanity of Strauss with perfect independence of one another. Beyond, on the narrow piazza, and on a division of the lawn that leaned to the road, were a number of small tables close-packed with girls in bright costumes and men in loose flannels and coats of diverting hues. At the open windows of the restaurant other groups were seated, dividing their attention between the food before them and the throng without. And through the crowd a number of Alsatians pushed their way, bearing concoctions to the thirstless. The hubbub was enervating, and in the air was a stench of liquor with which the sea breeze coped in vain.</p>
			<p>Tristrem hesitated a second, and would have fled. He was in one of those moods in which the noise and joviality of pleasure-seekers are jarring even to the best-disposed. While he hesitated he saw a figure rising and beckoning from a table on the lawn. And as he stood, uncertain whether or no the signals were intended for him, the figure crossed the intervening space, and he recognized Alphabet Jones.</p>
			<p>“Come and have a drink,” said that engaging individual. “You’re as solemn as a comedian. I give you my word, I believe you are the only sober man in the place.”</p>
			<p>“Thank you,” Tristrem answered; “I believe I do not care for anything. I only came to ask⁠—By the way, have you been here long?”</p>
			<p>“Off and on all summer. It’s a good place for points. You got my card, didn’t you? I wanted to express my sympathy at your bereavement.”</p>
			<p>“You are very kind; I⁠—”</p>
			<p>“But what’s this I hear about you? You’ve bloomed out into a celebrity. Everybody is talking about you⁠—everybody, men, women, and children, particularly the girls. When a fellow gives away a fortune like that! <i xml:lang="fr">Mais, tu sais, mon cher, c’est beau, c’est bien beau, ça.</i>” And to himself he added, “<i xml:lang="fr">Et bien bête.</i>”</p>
			<p>Already certain members of immediate groups had become interested in the new arrival, and it seemed to Tristrem that he heard his name circulating above the jangle of the waltz.</p>
			<p>“I am going to the hotel,” he said. “I wish you would walk back with me. I haven’t spoken to a soul in an age. It would be an act of charity to tell me the gossip.” Tristrem, as he made this invitation, marvelled at his own duplicity. For the time being, he cared for the society of Alphabet Jones as he cared for the companionship of a bum-bailiff. Yet still he lured him from the Casino and led him up the road, in the hope that perhaps without direct questioning he might gain some knowledge of Her.</p>
			<p>As they walked on Jones descanted in the arbitrary didactic manner which is the privilege of men of letters whose letters are not in capitals, and moralized on a variety of topics, not with any covert intention of boring Tristrem, but merely from a habit he had of rehearsing ready-made phrases and noting their effect on a particular listener. This exercise he found beneficial. In airing his views he sometimes stumbled on a good thing which he had not thought of in private. And as he talked Tristrem listened, in the hope that he might say something which would permit him to lead up to the subject that was foremost in his mind. But nothing of such a nature was touched upon, and it was not until the cottage was reached that Tristrem spoke at all.</p>
			<p>“The Raritans have gone, I see,” he remarked, nodding at the cottage as he did so.</p>
			<p>“Yes, I see by the papers that they sailed yesterday.”</p>
			<p>“You don’t mean to say they have gone to Europe. I thought⁠—I heard they were going to Lenox.”</p>
			<p>“If they were, they changed their plans. Miss Raritan didn’t seem up to the mark when she was here. In some way she reminded me of a realized ideal⁠—the charm had departed. She used to be enigmatical in her beauty, but this summer, though the beauty was still there, it was no longer enigmatical, it was like a problem solved. After all, it’s the way with our girls. A winter or two in New York would take the color out of the cheeks of a Red Indian. <i xml:lang="fr">Apropos de bottes</i>, weren’t you rather smitten in that direction?”</p>
			<p>“And you say they have gone abroad?” Tristrem repeated, utterly unimpressed by the ornateness of the novelist’s remarks.</p>
			<p>“Yes, sir; and were it not that our beastly Government declines to give me the benefit of an international copyright, I should be able to go and do likewise. It’s enough to turn an author into an anarchist. Why, you would be surprised⁠—”</p>
			<p>Jones rambled on, but Tristrem no longer listened. The position in which he found himself was more irritating than a dream. He was dumbly exasperated. It was his own inaction that was the cause of it all. If he had but bestirred himself sooner! Instead of struggling against that which every throb of his heart convinced him was false, he had dawdled with the impossible and toyed with apostils of grief. At the first obstacle he had turned aside. Where he should have been resolute, he had been weak. He had taken mists for barriers. A child frightened at its own shadow was never more absurd than he. And Viola⁠—it was not surprising that the color had deserted her cheeks. It was no wonder that in his imbecile silence she had gone away. It was only surprising that she had not gone before. And if she had waited, might it not be that she waited expectant of some effort from him, hoping against hope, and when he had made no sign had believed in his defeat, and left him to it. There was no blame for her. And now, if he were free again, that very liberty was due not to his own persistence, but to chance. Surely she was right to go. Yet⁠—yet⁠—but, after all, <em>it was not too late</em>. Wherever she had gone he could follow. He would find her, and tell her, and hold her to him.</p>
			<p>Already he smiled in scenes forecast. The exasperation had left him. Whether he came to Narragansett or journeyed to Paris, what matter did it make? The errand was identical, and the result would be the same. How foolish of him to be annoyed because he had not found her, in garlands of orange-blossoms, waiting on a balcony to greet his coming. The very fact of her absence added new weight to the import of his message. Yes, he would return to town at once, and the next steamer would bear him to her.</p>
			<p>And then, unconsciously, through some obscure channel of memory, he was back where he had once been, in a <i xml:lang="de">Gasthof</i> in the Bavarian Mountains. It was not yet dusk. Through the window came a choir of birds, and he could see the tender asparagus-green of neighborly trees. He was seated at a great, bare table of oak, and as he raised from it to his lips a stone measure of beer, his eyes rested on an engraving that hung on the wall. It represented a huntsman, galloping like mad, one steadying hand on the bridle and the other stretched forward to grasp a phantom that sped on before. Under the picture, in quaint German text, was the legend, <i epub:type="se:name.visual-art.engraving">The Chase After Happiness</i>. “H’m;” he mused, “I don’t see why I should think of that.”</p>
			<p>“That’s the gist of it all,” Jones was saying. “It’s the fashion to rail against critics. I remember telling one of the guild the other day not to read my books⁠—they might prejudice him in my favor; but in comparison to certain publishers the average reviewer stands as a misdemeanant does to a burglar. No, I have said it before and I say it again, until that copyright law is passed, the Government is guilty of nothing less than compounding a felony.”</p>
			<p>Of what had gone before Tristrem had not heard a single word, and these ultimate phrases which reached him were as meaningless as church-steeples. He started as one does from a nap, with that shake of the head which is peculiar to the absentminded. He was standing, he discovered, at the entrance to the hotel at which he lodged.</p>
			<p>“Don’t you agree with me?” Jones asked. “Come and lunch at the Casino. You will get nothing here. Narragansett cookery is as iniquitous as the legislature. Besides, at this hour they give you dinner. It is tragic, on my word, it is.”</p>
			<p>“Thank you,” Tristrem answered, elusively. “I have an appointment with⁠—with a train.” And with this excuse he entered the hotel, and as soon after as was practicable he returned to town.</p>
			<p>It was, he learned, as Jones had said. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Raritan and Miss Raritan were passengers on a steamer which had sailed two days before. It was then Friday. One of the swiftest Cunarders was to sail the following morning, and it seemed not improbable to Tristrem that he might reach the other side, if not simultaneously with, at least but a few hours after the arrival of the Wednesday boat. Such preparations, therefore, as were necessary he made without delay. As incidental thereto, he went to the house in Thirty-ninth Street. There he learned, from a squat little Irishwoman who came out from the area and eyed him with unmollifiable suspicion, that, like the Narragansett cottage, the house was to let. The only address which he could obtain from her was that of a real-estate agent in the lower part of the city. Thither he posted at once. Yet even there the information which he gleaned was meagre. The house was offered for a year. During that period, the agent understood, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Raritan proposed to complete her daughter’s musical education abroad; where, the agent did not know. The rental accruing from the lease of the house was to be paid over to the East and West Trust <abbr>Co.</abbr> Further than that he could say nothing. Thereupon Tristrem trudged hopefully to Wall Street; but the secretary of the East and West was vaguer even than the agent. He knew nothing whatever on the subject of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Raritan’s whereabouts, and from his tone it was apparent that he cared less. There is, however, an emollient in courtesy which has softened greater oafs than he, and that emollient Tristrem possessed. There was in his manner a penetrating and pervasive refinement, and at the gruffness with which he was received there came to his face an expression of such perplexity that the secretary, disarmed in spite of himself, turned from his busy idleness and told Tristrem that if <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Raritan had not left her address with him she must certainly have given it to the lawyer who held the power of attorney to collect the rents and profits of her estate. The name of that lawyer was Meggs, and his office was in the Mills Building.</p>
			<p>In the Mills Building Tristrem’s success was little better. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Meggs, the managing clerk announced, had left town an hour before and would not return until Monday. However, if there was anything <em>he</em> could do, he was entirely at Tristrem’s disposal. And then Tristrem explained his errand anew, adding that he sailed on the morrow, and that it was important for him to have <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Raritan’s address before he left. The clerk regretted, but he did not know it. Could not <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Meggs send it to him?</p>
			<p>“He might cable it, might he not?” Tristrem suggested. And as this plan seemed feasible, he gave the clerk a card with a London address scrawled on it, and therewith some coin. “I should be extremely indebted if you would beg <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Meggs to send me the address at once,” he added; and the clerk, who had read the name on the card and knew it to be that of the claimant and renouncer of a great estate, assured him that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Meggs would take great pleasure in so doing.</p>
			<p>After that there was nothing for Tristrem to do but to return to his grandfather’s house and complete his preparations. He dined with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Van Norden that evening, and a very pleasant dinner it was. Together they talked of those matters and memories that were most congenial to them; <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Van Norden looking steadily in the past, and Tristrem straight into the future. And at last, at midnight, when the carriage came to take Tristrem to the wharf⁠—for the ship was to sail at so early an hour in the morning that it was deemed expedient for the passengers to sleep on board⁠—as Tristrem took leave of his grandfather, “Bring her back soon,” the old gentleman said, “bring her back as soon as you can. And, Tristrem, you must take this to her once more, with an old man’s love and blessing.”</p>
			<p>Whereupon he gave Tristrem again the diamond brooch that had belonged to his daughter.</p>
